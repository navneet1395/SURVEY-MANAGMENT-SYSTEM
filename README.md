# SURVEY MANAGMENT SYSTEM

The Project titled Online Survey System is a database connectivity application
that uses front end as HTML, CSS, and backend as PHP/MySQLi, JavaScript
(jQuery/Ajax), and Bootstrap for the design.
The Online Survey System is a simple project that can help a certain school,
company or any organization that conducting surveys within its circle. The
system has 2 types of users which is the admin and subscribers/users. The admin
is the one who manages all the data of this system also the user role who is
permitted to create a new user. The subscribers/users are those system users
that answer the survey. The system has a simple form builder feature to create
a survey questionnaire. The survey form builder has only 3 options to choose
from for the type of inputs on how the users/subscribers answer the questions.
The 3 options are the radio options, checkbox, and text area. The radio button
will be used if the survey question requires only (1) one answer and the
checkbox is for the survey question that allows multiple options that can
user/subscriber choose. The text area will serve the dynamic survey question
such as the comment. The system generates a printable report for the result of
each survey set.
